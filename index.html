          <h3>What is ADHD</h3>
          <!-- yessir-->
          <p>
            ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of
            childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often
            lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying
            attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking
            about what the result will be), or be overly active.
          </p>

            Also notice that we have set overflow:auto to sidenav. This will add
            a scrollbar when the sidenav is too long (for example if it has over
            50 links inside of it).
          </p>
          <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
          <p>
            It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at
            one time or another. However, children with ADHD do not just grow
            out of these behaviors. The symptoms continue, can be severe, and
            can cause difficulty at school, at home, or with friends. A child
            with ADHD might:
            <li>
              Daydream a lot forget or lose things a lot squirm or fidget talk
              too much make careless mistakes
            </li>
            <li>
              take unnecessary risks have a hard time resisting temptation have
              trouble taking turns have difficulty getting along with others
              Learn more about signs and symptoms.
            </li>
          </p>
          <h3>Types</h3>
          <p>
            There are three different types of ADHD, depending on which types of
            symptoms are strongest in the individual: Predominantly Inattentive
            Presentation: It is hard for the individual to organize or finish a
            task, to pay attention to details, or to follow instructions or
            conversations. The person is easily distracted or forgets details of
            daily routines. Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:
            The person fidgets and talks a lot. It is hard to sit still for long
            (e.g., for a meal or while doing homework). Smaller children may
            run, jump or climb constantly. The individual feels restless and has
            trouble with impulsivity. Someone who is impulsive may interrupt
            others a lot, grab things from people, or speak at inappropriate
            times. It is hard for the person to wait their turn or listen to
            directions. A person with impulsiveness may have more accidents and
            injuries than others. Combined Presentation: Symptoms of the above
            two types are equally present in the person. Because symptoms can
            change over time, the presentation may change over time as well.

            Causes of ADHD
          </h3>
          <p>
            Scientists are studying cause(s) and risk factors in an effort to
            find better ways to manage and reduce the chances of a person having
            ADHD. The cause(s) and risk factors for ADHD are unknown, but
            current research shows that genetics plays an important role. Recent
            studies of twins link genes with ADHD.1 In addition to genetics,
            scientists are studying other possible causes and risk factors
            including: Brain injury Exposure to environmental (e.g., lead)
            during pregnancy or at a young age Alcohol and tobacco use during
            pregnancy Premature delivery Low birth weight Research does not
            support the popularly held views that ADHD is caused by eating too
            much sugar, watching too much television, parenting, or social and
            environmental factors such as poverty or family chaos. Of course,
            many things, including these, might make symptoms worse, especially
            in certain people. But the evidence is not strong enough to conclude
            that they are the main causes of ADHD.

          <h4>
            Diagnosis
          </h4>
          <p>
            Deciding if a child has ADHD is a process with several steps. There
            is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, like
            anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and certain types of learning
            disabilities, can have similar symptoms. One step of the process
            involves having a medical exam, including hearing and vision tests,
            to rule out other problems with symptoms like ADHD. Diagnosing ADHD
            usually includes a checklist for rating ADHD symptoms and taking a
            history of the child from parents, teachers, and sometimes, the
            child.

          <h5>
            Treatments
          </h5>
          <p>
            In most cases, ADHD is best treated with a combination of behavior
            therapy and medication. For preschool-aged children (4-5 years of
            age) with ADHD, behavior therapy, particularly training for parents,
            is recommended as the first line of treatment before medication is
            tried. What works best can depend on the child and family. Good
            treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and
            making changes, if needed, along the way.

            Managing Symptoms: Staying Healthy
          </h6>
          <p>
            Being healthy is important for all children and can be especially
            important for children with ADHD. In addition to behavioral therapy
            and medication, having a healthy lifestyle can make it easier for
            your child to deal with ADHD symptoms. Here are some healthy
            behaviors that may help: Developing healthy eating habits such as
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and choosing
              lean protein sources
            </li>
